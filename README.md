Linear Regression
-----------------
It is used to predict some y values based on the value of another set of X values

- created in 1800s by Francis Galton
- Galton was investigating the relationship between the heights of fathers and the heights of their sons.
- he said “A father’s son’s height tends to regress (or drift towards) the mean (average) height”

### Mathematics of Linear Regression
- While creating a regression model, all that we are trying to do is draw a line that is as close as possible to each point in a dataset
- The typical example of this is the “least squares method” of linear regression, which only calculates the closeness of a line to the x values in the up-and-down (vertical offsets) direction.

Logistic Regression
-------------------
It is similar to linear
